# Tailwind Color Translator for VSCode

Tailwind Color Translator is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline the workflow of front-end developers by translating HEX color values into equivalent Tailwind CSS classes. This tool bridges the gap between custom color palettes and Tailwind's utility-first approach, ensuring a more efficient and integrated development experience.
